# .xlsx_convert
This project is simple but gets the job done, it takes .xlsx files and converts them to .csv. It has a pratically identical simple ui like my .html_filter.py tool but does something completley differnt. 

How to use:
1. create a folder with whatever files you want to convert
2. copy the path to that directory 
3. open xlsx_con.py
4. paste the directory 
5. name the output file

**The output file will be placed in whatever directory the tool itself is stored**

If there is anyway you think i can improve it or if you have any sugestions on python projects to help me learn to program fell free to reach out to me on discord @blanko_zr If you like leave a star thank you.
